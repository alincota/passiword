# passiword
Bash script (and optional GUI for non-technicals) to quickly generate a random, human memorable passphrase.

The script is meant to be just a random word generator based on a predefined list of words. The idea is that what you later do with the words is up to you (e.g if you want to add special characters or capitalise them).

# Installation
Simply clone it to your desired location (e.g /opt/). Make sure it has execute permissions.

## GUI
If you want to allow less technical users to get a random passphrase generated by using the GUI, use the [passiword.desktop](passiword.desktop) to quickly call passiword and notify user of their new passphrase (which they can copy and use as needed).

Copy [passiword.desktop](passiword.desktop) to **/usr/share/applications** (ensure permissions are OK). Test with `gtk-launch /usr/share/applications/passiword.desktop`

# Nice to have:
- [ ] Generate (and distribute) X number of special characters and/or numbers
